# Sensor Node
Simple dual-panel design for sensor node.
Can support an Up Board, a Rasp Pi, an Arduino, an Edison, or a Galileo board
as processor, has a grid for Grove sensors, slots for wire management, and
holes for a camera and a 4D display panel.  Also has feet that can be 
adjusted to tilt the camera at a fixed angle, and slots to allow multiple
sensor nodes to be stacked.

This is a 2D design but is implemented using OpenSCAD to allow parameterization.
